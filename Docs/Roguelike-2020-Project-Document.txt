Roguelike 2020 - Project Document
=================================

The aim of this document is to plan the activities and keep track of decision taken during the game development.

Game theme and assets
---------------------
The game will have a post-apocaplyptic theme and will use the 2D Roguelike free assets from the Unity Asset Store.

Development Choices
-------------------
The level is generated with a couple of nested loops and a random generator. A matrix of booleand tracks if a cell is taken or not, to avoid superposition.
Three different multiplication factors (dirt, food, enemies) can be used to tune the level difficulty.
